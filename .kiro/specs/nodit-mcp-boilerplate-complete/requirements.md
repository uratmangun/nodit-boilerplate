5. WHEN a user scrolls through messages THEN the chat area SHALL be scrollable
6. WHEN a user views messages THEN they SHALL be clearly distinguished between user and bot messages

### Requirement 4: Live MCP Tools Integration
**User Story:** As a developer interested in MCP tools, I want to see real-time listing of available Nodit MCP tools, so that I can understand what services are available for integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user visits /mcp THEN the system SHALL connect to https://nodit-mcp.uratmangun.fun/sse
2. WHEN the connection is establishing THEN the user SHALL see a loading state with connection status
3. WHEN the connection fails THEN the user SHALL see an error state with retry options
4. WHEN the connection succeeds THEN the user SHALL see a dynamic list of available MCP tools
5. WHEN tools are loaded THEN they SHALL be categorized by type (Blockchain APIs, Data Services, etc.)
6. WHEN a user searches tools THEN the list SHALL be filtered by name and description
7. WHEN a user selects a category THEN only tools from that category SHALL be displayed
8. WHEN tools are displayed THEN each SHALL show name, description, status, and capabilities

### Requirement 5: GitHub Template Functionality
**User Story:** As a developer wanting to use this boilerplate, I want the repository to be configured as a GitHub template, so that I can easily create new projects based on it.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a developer visits the GitHub repository THEN it SHALL be marked as a template repository
2. WHEN a developer wants to create a new project THEN they SHALL be able to use the "Use this template" button
3. WHEN the homepage displays the clone command THEN it SHALL use the correct GitHub CLI template syntax
4. WHEN a user copies the command THEN it SHALL include the proper template cloning format

### Requirement 6: Responsive Design and Theming
**User Story:** As a user accessing the application from different devices, I want a responsive design that works well on mobile and desktop, so that I can use the application regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria
