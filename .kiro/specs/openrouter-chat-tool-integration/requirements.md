# OpenRouter Chat and Tool Integration Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing an OpenAI-compatible chat interface using OpenRouter API with integrated MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool-calling capabilities. The system enables users to interact with AI models through a web interface while providing the AI with access to blockchain-related tools through the Nodit MCP server. The implementation includes multi-tool chaining support, markdown rendering, robust error handling, and graceful connection state management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: OpenRouter API Integration
**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use OpenRouter API for chat completions, so that I can access multiple AI models through a single interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user configures their OpenRouter API key THEN the system SHALL store it securely in localStorage
2. WHEN a user selects a model name THEN the system SHALL persist the selection in localStorage
3. WHEN a user sends a chat message THEN the system SHALL make requests to https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions
4. WHEN making API requests THEN the system SHALL include proper authorization headers with Bearer token
5. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL include HTTP-Referer and X-Title headers as required by OpenRouter

### Requirement 2: Chat Interface and User Experience
**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive chat interface with proper visual feedback, so that I can easily interact with AI models.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user types a message THEN the system SHALL display it immediately in the chat history
2. WHEN the AI responds THEN the system SHALL render the response as formatted markdown
3. WHEN API calls are in progress THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages in the chat
5. WHEN the chat input is focused THEN the system SHALL allow message submission via Enter key

### Requirement 3: MCP Tool Integration
**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to access blockchain tools automatically, so that I can get real-time blockchain data and insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the MCP server is connected THEN the system SHALL expose available tools to the AI
2. WHEN the AI requests tool execution THEN the system SHALL call the appropriate MCP tool with provided arguments
3. WHEN tools are executed THEN the system SHALL display execution status and results in the chat
4. WHEN tool execution fails THEN the system SHALL show error messages and continue the conversation
5. WHEN multiple tools are requested THEN the system SHALL execute them sequentially and chain results

### Requirement 4: Multi-Tool Chaining Support
**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to use multiple tools in sequence, so that complex queries can be answered through automated tool orchestration.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the AI response contains tool_calls THEN the system SHALL execute all requested tools
2. WHEN tool results are available THEN the system SHALL send them back to the AI for processing
3. WHEN the AI requests additional tools after receiving results THEN the system SHALL continue the chain
4. WHEN the tool chain is complete THEN the system SHALL display the final AI response
5. WHEN any tool in the chain fails THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and continue

### Requirement 5: Connection State Management
**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback about system connectivity, so that I understand when features are available or unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the MCP server is disconnected THEN the system SHALL disable the chat input
2. WHEN the MCP server is disconnected THEN the system SHALL display a retry button
3. WHEN the user clicks retry THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect to the MCP server
4. WHEN the MCP server reconnects THEN the system SHALL re-enable the chat input
5. WHEN connection state changes THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback to the user

### Requirement 6: Tool Discovery and Display
**User Story:** As a user, I want to see available tools, so that I understand what capabilities the AI has access to.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the MCP server is connected THEN the system SHALL display a list of available tools
2. WHEN displaying tools THEN the system SHALL show tool names and descriptions
3. WHEN tools are listed THEN the system SHALL NOT include execute buttons (simplified UI)
4. WHEN the tool list updates THEN the system SHALL refresh the display automatically
5. WHEN no tools are available THEN the system SHALL show an appropriate message

## Non-functional Requirements

### Performance Requirements
- Chat message sending SHALL complete within 2 seconds under normal network conditions
- Tool execution SHALL provide status feedback within 500ms of initiation
- UI updates SHALL be responsive and not block user interaction during API calls
- The system SHALL handle concurrent tool executions efficiently

### Security Requirements
- API keys SHALL be stored in localStorage with appropriate security considerations
- API requests SHALL use HTTPS for all communications
- Tool execution SHALL validate input parameters before processing
- Error messages SHALL not expose sensitive system information

### Usability Requirements
- The chat interface SHALL be intuitive and require no training for basic use
- Error messages SHALL be clear and actionable for end users
- Loading states SHALL provide clear visual feedback during operations
- The system SHALL maintain chat history during the session

### Reliability Requirements
- The system SHALL gracefully handle network failures and API errors
- Tool execution failures SHALL not crash the chat interface
- Connection state changes SHALL be handled without data loss
- The system SHALL recover automatically from temporary disconnections

### Compatibility Requirements
- The system SHALL work with all OpenRouter-supported AI models
- The implementation SHALL be compatible with the existing React/TypeScript codebase
- The system SHALL integrate seamlessly with the existing MCP infrastructure
- The interface SHALL be responsive across desktop and mobile devices
