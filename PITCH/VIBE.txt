Kiro excels at structured development workflows. Start with clear requirements, break complex features into discrete tasks, and leverage parallel tool execution for efficiency. Best practices: use #File context for targeted edits, create specs before coding, and iterate incrementally. Kiro shines with React components, API integrations, and full-stack architectures. The key is being specific about what you want - "build a responsive dashboard with user auth" gets better results than vague requests.
