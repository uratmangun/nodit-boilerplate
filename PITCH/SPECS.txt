Kiro specs revolutionize development with structured 3-file approach: requirements.md (user stories + acceptance criteria), design.md (architecture + components), tasks.md (trackable implementation steps). Each spec transforms complex features into clear, actionable plans. Examples show complete web apps, API integrations, and full-stack projects broken into discrete tasks with requirement traceability. Specs enable iterative development, clear documentation, and systematic implementation.
