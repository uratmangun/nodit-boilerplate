Automated 20+ development workflows with Kiro hooks: auto-generated README files, conventional Git commits with emoji, OSI license creation, project asset synchronization across repositories, Kiro spec generation, filename synchronization, Akindo pitch creation, and Kiro-to-Windsurf rule conversion. These hooks eliminated repetitive tasks, ensured consistent documentation, standardized commit messages, and automated cross-project configuration management, saving hours of manual work daily.
