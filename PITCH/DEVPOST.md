# Nodit MCP Boilerplate

**Project Name:** Nodit MCP Boilerplate  
**Elevator Pitch:** A modern React boilerplate for integrating blockchain data analysis through Nodit's Model Context Protocol with live AI chat and real-time tool discovery.

## Inspiration

The blockchain development ecosystem is fragmented, with developers struggling to integrate AI-powered data analysis into their applications. While Model Context Protocol (MCP) promises to bridge AI and external tools, there was no comprehensive boilerplate for blockchain-specific integrations. We were inspired by the potential to democratize blockchain data analysis by creating a ready-to-use template that combines modern web development with cutting-edge AI capabilities.

The vision was simple: enable any developer to build blockchain-aware AI applications in minutes, not months.

## What it does

The Nodit MCP Boilerplate is a comprehensive web application template that provides:

**üîó Live MCP Integration**
- Real-time connection to Nodit's MCP server via Server-Sent Events
- Dynamic discovery and categorization of 15+ blockchain analysis tools
- Automatic tool status monitoring and connection recovery

**üí¨ AI-Powered Chat Interface**
- OpenRouter API integration supporting 100+ AI models
- Intelligent tool calling with automatic blockchain data retrieval
- Markdown rendering with syntax highlighting for technical responses

**üõ†Ô∏è Dynamic Tool Dashboard**
- Live listing of available MCP tools (Blockchain APIs, Data Services, Node Access)
- Real-time search and filtering capabilities
- Interactive tool documentation with example parameters and responses

**üì¶ GitHub Template Distribution**
- One-click project creation via GitHub CLI
- Comprehensive documentation and setup guides
- Production-ready configuration with modern tooling

**üé® Modern Developer Experience**
- React 19 with TypeScript for type safety
- Vite for lightning-fast development
- shadcn/ui components with dark/light theme support
- Comprehensive testing suite with Vitest

## How we built it

**Architecture & Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite for modern development experience
- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui built on Radix UI primitives for accessibility
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom green gradient theme
- **MCP Integration**: `use-mcp` React hook for real-time server communication
- **AI Integration**: OpenRouter API for multi-model AI capabilities
- **Backend Ready**: Supabase integration for authentication and data persistence
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library for comprehensive coverage

**Key Implementation Challenges:**

1. **Real-time MCP Connection Management**
   - Implemented robust connection state handling (loading, ready, failed)
   - Added automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
   - Created user-friendly error recovery options

2. **Dynamic Tool Discovery & Categorization**
   - Built intelligent categorization system based on tool names and descriptions
   - Implemented real-time search and filtering
   - Created interactive tool cards with live status indicators

3. **AI Chat with Tool Calling**
   - Integrated OpenRouter API with MCP tool calling capabilities
   - Implemented conversation flow with tool execution results
   - Added markdown rendering for technical blockchain data

4. **Developer Experience Optimization**
   - Created comprehensive GitHub template configuration
   - Built modular component architecture for easy customization
   - Implemented proper error boundaries and loading states

## Challenges we ran into

**1. MCP Protocol Integration Complexity**
The Model Context Protocol specification was relatively new, requiring deep understanding of Server-Sent Events and tool calling patterns. We had to build robust connection management from scratch.

**2. Real-time Tool State Management**
Managing the state of 15+ blockchain tools with different connection states, capabilities, and error conditions required careful state architecture and error handling.

**3. AI Model Integration**
Integrating multiple AI models through OpenRouter while maintaining tool calling capabilities required understanding different model capabilities and response formats.

**4. Blockchain Data Visualization**
Presenting complex blockchain data (transaction hashes, smart contract calls, token transfers) in a user-friendly format while maintaining technical accuracy.

**5. Performance Optimization**
Ensuring smooth real-time updates while handling large amounts of blockchain data without overwhelming the UI or causing memory leaks.
